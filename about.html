	<h2>About the Opera</h2>
	<h4><a href="http://beckmusic.org/compositions/black-water-for-soprano-piano/">Black Water</a></h4>
	<p><i>Black Water</i> is a one-act opera, a monodrama for Soprano and piano by Jeremy Beck. The opera
	is based on a novel by Joyce Carol Oates, which is a slightly-veiled fictional account of the 
	incident at Chappaquiddick Island, Massachussetts, in the summer of 1969. That summer, the dead body of a young woman, Mary Jo Kopechne, 
	was discovered inside an overturned car in a channel on the island. The car belonged to Senator Edward M. <q>Ted</q> Kennedy, who did not report 
	the late-night incident to police authorities until the following morning.</p>

	<p>After the discovery, Kopechne&#39;s body was recovered from the submerged car and Kennedy gave a statement to police saying that during the 
	previous night, she was his passenger when he took a wrong turn and accidentally drove his car off a bridge and into the water. After pleading 
	guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident after causing injury, Kennedy received a suspended sentence of two months. The national 
	scandal that followed may have influenced Kennedy&#39;s decision not to campaign for President of the United States in 1972 and 1976.</p>
	<p>While performing this contemplative piece, the soprano and the pianist assume multiple roles and states of mind (following 
	the variety of levels created by Oates). The work is presented almost completely from the point of view of the 
	drowning woman: in reality, in flashback, in dreams and in hallucinations. This dramatic production premiered 
	in 1995 at the University of Northern Iowa, and has been performed in the United States as well as internationally.</p>

	<h2>About the Composer</h2>

	<h4><a href="http://www.beckmusic.org/">Jeremy Beck</a></h4>
	<p><q>&#91;This&#93; American composer knows the importance of embracing the past while also going his own way... &#91;In&#93; Beck&#39;s forceful and expressive sound world... 
	the writing is concise in structure and generous in tonal language, savouring both the dramatic and the poetic.</q></p>

	<p>&#150; Donald Rosenberg (Gramophone, Dec. 2013)</p>


	<p>Called <q>an original voice celebrating music</q> by MusicWeb International (2009), Jeremy Beck&#39;s music has been described by NewMusicBox (2012) 
	as <q>rhythmically intricate, and &#91;making&#93; nods to the past while sitting squarely in the present... Though architecturally rigorous, Beck writes 
	clearly and without pretense&#91;.&#93;</q></p>

	<p>Based in Louisville, Kentucky, Beck&#39;s music has been presented by New York City Opera, American Composers Orchestra, the Slovak Radio 
	Symphony Orchestra, Orchestra Iowa, the Albuquerque Symphony Orchestra, Portland (Maine) Symphony Orchestra, Center for Contemporary Opera, 
	Peabody Opera, Yale Opera, the Dallas Festival of Modern Music, IonSound Project, Pacific Serenades, and the Nevsky String Quartet, among others.</p>

	<h4><a href="http://www.andrewkraus.com/">Andrew Kraus</a></h4>

	<img src="kraus.jpg" width="250" alt="Kraus" title="Andrew Headshot"/>

	<p>The current focus of Mr. Kraus&#39; solo work is a series of programs  featuring pieces from <q>The Golden Age of the Piano</q> to be performed
	 in recital as well as recorded.  In his own words, <q>I was extremely fortunate to have been accepted as a student by David Saperton in 
	the last months of his life in New York City.  I absolutely loved his playing. Experiencing it in the intimacy of his studio was, for me, 
	an initiation into a way of playing the piano that had been lost as well as an introduction to a genre of wonderfully beautiful and 
	interesting music that had fallen out of fashion.  I want, as much as it is possible, to bring the experience of  that type of music and 
	music making to contemporary audiences.  I truly love that music, and when and wherever I share it with people, they have responded with 
	great enthusiasm.</q></p>

	<p>Mr. Kraus  has performed as a soloist across the U.S., Europe, and Asia in recitals. He has been a performing participant in master 
	classes with Peter Feuchtwanger and Leon Fleisher. In Spring 2009, he performed as  featured soloist with The Mantovani Orchestra on 
	their Spring tour of China.</p>

	<p>Mr. Kraus  is recognized  for his work as an accomplished and sensitive collaborator, working with singers and instrumentalists in 
	concerts around the greater Washington, DC area as well as for his work coaching emerging performers. In July 2010 he returned for his 
	third year on staff as a coach at the Crittenden Summer Opera Studio in Chevy Chase, MD, and in April 2011 he joins Soprano, Mary 
	Gresock, in an opera outreach program for Ash Lawn Opera.</p>

	<p>Mr. Kraus holds degrees from Boston University (B.M.) and East Carolina University (M.M.), and has studied with Peter Feuchtwanger, 
	Lily Kraus, David Saperton, Ward Davenny, Bela Nagy and chamber music with Artur Balsam.</p>

	<p>Mr. Kraus is former Instructor of Music and Staff Accompanist at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia where he 
	accompanied recitals and appeared as a soloist with the University Wind Ensemble playing George Gershwin&#39;s Rhapsody in Blue and 
	Igor Stravinsky&#39;s Concerto for Piano and Winds.</p>
