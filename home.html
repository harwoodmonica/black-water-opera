	<h2>Black Water</h2>
	<h4>An Opera by Jeremy Beck</h4>
	<p>In 1969, the dead body of a young woman, Mary Jo Kopechne, was discovered 
	inside an overturned car in a channel on Chappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts. 
	The car belonged to Senator Edward M. <q>Ted</q> Kennedy, who did not report the 
	late-night incident to police authorities until the following morning. After the 
	discovery, Kopechne&#39;s body was recovered from the submerged car and Kennedy gave a 
	statement to police saying that during the previous night, she was his passenger 
	when he took a wrong turn and accidentally drove his car off a bridge and into 
	the water. After pleading guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident 
	after causing injury, Kennedy received a suspended sentence of two months. The 
	national scandal that followed may have influenced Kennedy&#39;s decision not to 
	campaign for President of the United States in 1972 and 1976.<p>

	<p>Black Water by Joyce Carol Oates is a slightly-veiled fictional account of these 
	events. This extended composition is dramatically effective as both a concert 
	work and as a staged monodrama. Whether in a concert setting or in the theater, 
	the soprano and the pianist assume multiple roles and states of mind (following 
	the variety of levels created by Oates).The work is presented almost completely 
	from the point of view of the 
	drowning woman: in reality, in flashback, in dreams and in hallucinations.</p>
